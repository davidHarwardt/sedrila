# `sedrila evaluator`: statistically assess the behavior of one full cohort of SeDriLa students

`sedrila evaluator` is a data extraction and statistical evaluation tailored to `sedrila`.
Its main purpose is helping course organizers and developers understand 
student progress as the course unfolds and
what tasks came out how in actual course practice after the course ends.

It is currently an **experimental function**, is under heavy development, 
and might change abruptly.
Do not rely on anything here yet.
